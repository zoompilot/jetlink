Getting a large model's ONNX by its git-lfs oid.

comma overwrites one file per model, so the commit is the only name a big
model's ONNX has. GitHub's raw host serves the LFS pointer for any commit it
holds, merged or not, and that pointer carries the oid and size the comma will
ask a jetlink server for. The bytes themselves are on comma's LFS servers,
which is GitLab and not GitHub: each is asked in turn because which one has an
object varies with the model's age.

Since openpilot #38930 (2026-09-16) a commit can ship a precompiled tinygrad
pkl instead, with no ONNX in the tree at all; Cinque Terre V3 is one. Its
subject names the export ("Use f78ed37d for the precompiled eGPU driving
model") and the ONNX is in comma's HuggingFace model repo, in the folder that
id starts. sunnypilot's model builds find it the same way. That repo speaks
the LFS batch protocol too, so it is one more endpoint to ask.

This mirrors the fork's openpilot/sunnypilot/accelerators/jetlink/lfs.py: same
URLs, same endpoint order, same verify rules, no openpilot imports.
