sunnypilot's big-model catalog: which large models exist and which commit each one is.

The catalog is the same JSON the comma's model manager caches for its chestnut
slot, so a model picked here is a model the comma can ask for. A bundle's
artifacts are tinygrad pkls for a GPU we do not have; the only field that
matters is `ref`, the comma openpilot commit the bundle was compiled from,
because that commit's ONNX is what a jetlink server runs.

Stdlib only, and every network call takes an `opener` so tests stay offline.
