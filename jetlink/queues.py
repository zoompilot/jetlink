A queued graph's history buffers, in numpy: the reference the server's staging
is held to.

openpilot folds these into the tinygrad JIT on the GPU. Shipping the history
across the link would cost ~10 MB a frame, so the queues live on the server and
the comma sends only the newest warped frame and the packed scalars. The hidden
state the graph returns stays there too: the next frame pushes it into the
features queue, where modeld's prev_feat went. tests/test_queues.py holds this
to openpilot's tinygrad original, and the staging conformance fixture
(JetlinkKit/Scripts/make_conformance_fixtures.py) holds the Swift server's
queues to this, bit for bit.

openpilot's rolling `cat(buf[1:], new)`, stored in float16 rather than cast at
the model boundary, which gives the same values since each row is cast once.
Pass dtype=np.float32 for openpilot's exact intermediates.

A stateful graph (openpilot #38916) does the queueing itself, so there is
nothing here for one of those.
