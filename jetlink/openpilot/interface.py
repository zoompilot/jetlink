What jetlink needs from openpilot, as one interface the fork implements.

jetlink never imports openpilot. The fork has one adapter module that holds
every openpilot import jetlink needs; it implements `Openpilot` below and
hands the object in, and jetlink.openpilot reaches openpilot through it and
nothing else. So jetlink is tested against a fake, and an openpilot sync that
moves something jetlink relies on fails the adapter's tests in the fork, where
the fix belongs.

The interface is split by process. The resident gadget owner gets data only
(OwnerConfig), no callbacks, so it stays at the standard library and about
10 MB. The heavy processes get the adapter object and each uses its side:
StatusSide in manager, the UI, hardwared and the model manager, WorkerSide in
the provisioning run, ModelSide in modeld.

The standard library only: the owner imports this module.
