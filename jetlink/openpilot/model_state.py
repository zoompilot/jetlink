A ModelState whose policy runs on the Jetson.

Everything that touches the car stays on the comma: cameras, calibration, the
warp, the parser, controlsd, panda, CAN. The Jetson is a pure function, warped
frames and context in, 18452 floats out, and holds no control state.

The split is at `run_policy`. The warp stays on the comma's GPU: its input is a
2 MB camera buffer already there and its output the 393 KB the link carries
anyway. The history queues live on the Jetson, shipping them would cost ~10 MB
a frame instead of ~0.5 MB. modeld runs its warp as a JIT of its own, and
the link runs the same one; see warp.

A model that keeps its own history (openpilot #38916, Cinque Terre V3 on)
takes the same warped frame and the same scalars; its hidden state never
leaves the Jetson, so there is no prev_feat to send back. The spec says which.

What openpilot's modeld reads off a ModelState comes from the fork's adapter
(ModelFace): comma's constants, parser, smoothing and action function.
tinygrad is warp.Warp's to import: only modeld has it.
