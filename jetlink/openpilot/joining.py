A ModelState that starts as the small model and upgrades to the Jetson.

modeld's large-model load is a one-shot with BIG_MODEL_TIMEOUT and a silent,
one-way fallback. That suits a chestnut, powered from the comma. A Jetson is
on the ignition rail: cranking browns it out, so its boot starts about when
the comma goes onroad and takes 45 to 100 s, long after modeld gave up.

So modeld is handed the small model it already loaded, and the Jetson is
swapped in underneath once the link, the engine and the warp are all there.
modeld re-reads `model` every frame, and `modelV2.big` keeps its meaning.

Until the swap the comma runs its own model and nothing else; the link idles
on a keepalive ping. The large model is built on the swap frame and starts
from a reset history, as at every modeld start. The second after the swap is
its proof: the fork holds engagement off for it, and a large model that holds
a frame in it (model_state.PROVING_FRAMES) hands back before anyone can
engage. While it drives, a reply that is not back in time is not waited for:
the previous frame's output is published again (a held frame,
model_state.HOLD_FRAME) and the camera frame is not dropped. Too many holds
hand the drive back to the small model, as a lost link does.

Shadow frames, every frame sent to the host while the small model drove, were
tried and removed (2026-10-05). They cost the comma ~9 ms of every frame for
as long as the window stayed shut, a whole drive with MADS on, which starved
the driver monitoring model under selfdrived's frequency floor (commIssue).
Their proof, scored after the small model's own frame, could not pass behind
a small model that took most of the frame, however fast the host.

Two rules the swap keeps:

- tinygrad work happens on modeld's thread. The joining thread does link IO
  only; building the JetlinkModelState unpickles a TinyJit, and doing that
  next to the small model running frames on the same device is not safe.
- never swap while the plan is steering. The two models disagree by ~195 m of
  planned path, and the swap costs a frame or two. The adapter says before
  every frame whether anything is in control (in_control), from openpilot's
  own messages; standstill alone is not enough, longitudinal control may still
  hold the brake.
