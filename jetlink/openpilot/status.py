What the UI, hardwared and manager are told, in one snapshot, and the
progress the panels show while something provisions or joins.

Every answer here is files and params, no link IO: the UI asks five times a
second. The fork maps the snapshot onto its own widgets; the one mapping that
is jetlink's knowledge, which icon a state is, is Status.icon.

Light at module level: the package imports it, and the owner imports the package.
