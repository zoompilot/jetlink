The comma-side warp: openpilot's own, where it lives, what loads it, how the
frame loop runs it (Warp), and the small model's reset for a fallback.

The warp stays on the comma (see model_state). openpilot's modeld runs it as
a JIT of its own, driving_warp_{w}x{h}_tinygrad.pkl, one per camera, and the
link runs the same pickle: both camera frames in as one (2, frame size) uint8
input_frame, their transforms as one (2, 3, 3) M_inv, and out the
(2, 6, 128, 256) uint8 frame the link sends. The fork's adapter says where it
is. Nothing compiles one at runtime: a device without one runs the small
model.

load() is what stands between a bad pickle and the car.

tinygrad is the fork's, and only modeld has it: every import of it here is
inside the function that needs it.

  camera buffers in, as modeld does, and the transforms beside them. Two
  things the JIT alone does not do, measured on the comma with the warp
  jetlink once built itself (2026-10-06):
  - Its output lives in GPU memory the CPU reads through its cache. tinygrad
    maps a QCOM buffer write-combined, which the CPU reads uncached: copying
    the 393 KB out took 2.9 ms, the kernel's copy straight from that mapping
    7.3 ms. The Adreno 630 is IO-coherent, so KGSL memory flagged IOCOHERENT
    and write-back is right to read once the GPU is done: 0.22 ms for the
    kernel's copy, the GPU's own time unchanged. It moves before the first
    call, which links the JIT to its buffers' addresses.
  - TinyJit prepares and checks every call's inputs, a graph rewrite per
    input: 0.97 ms of a 1.93 ms call. Every frame's inputs are the same two
    buffers, which start() writes into, so they are checked once, by the
    warm-up's calls through TinyJit, and a frame replays the capture.

  The warm-up, the link of the JIT and its first runs, is paid here rather
  than on modeld's frame loop.
